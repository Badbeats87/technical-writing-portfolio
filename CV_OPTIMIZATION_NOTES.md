## How to Use This

### Option A: Simple Fix (15 minutes)
1. Copy the content from `CV_ATS_Optimized.txt`
2. Create a new Word/Google Docs document
3. Format it simply (standard fonts, no graphics, consistent spacing)
4. Export as PDF

### Option B: Better Looking (30 minutes)
1. Use the optimized content structure
2. Create a clean, professional layout in Word/Docs
3. Use consistent formatting: clear sections, bullet points, standard fonts
4. Keep it visually simple (ATS prefers simple over fancy)

## Key ATS Best Practices

✓ **Use standard fonts** (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
✓ **Keep formatting simple** (bold, bullets, basic structure)
✓ **Use standard section headers** (Experience, Education, Skills)
✓ **Save as PDF** (not Word - PDF is more ATS-friendly)
✓ **Include relevant keywords** from job descriptions you're targeting
✓ **Keep to 1-2 pages** (ATS works better with concise content)
✓ **Use standard bullet points** (•, -, *)
✓ **Avoid** tables, images, graphics, unusual fonts, color

## Testing Your CV

Before submitting:
1. Open the PDF and use Ctrl+F to search for key terms from job postings
2. If you can find those terms in your CV, ATS likely can too
3. If job posting mentions "API documentation" and your CV doesn't, consider adding it if relevant

## Next Steps

1. Update your PDF CV using this content
2. Keep multiple versions:
   - ATS-optimized version (for online applications)
   - More visually designed version (for sending directly to recruiters)
3. Customize the competencies section for each job application with relevant keywords
