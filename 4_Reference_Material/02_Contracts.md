A contract is a structured set of rules and constraints that define the working conditions for an employee or group of employees. It outlines the agreed terms of employment and plays a key role in automated scheduling and compliance.

You can create an unlimited number of contracts and assign them to people based on roles, availability, or specific working agreements. Learn more in {% link_new Create contracts | features/administration/create-contracts.md %}.

The settings and time constraints defined in a contract are used in scheduling and by the optimized schedule function, also referred to as AutoScheduler. Learn more in {% link_new Create an optimized schedule | features/scheduling/schedules/schedules-optimized-schedules.md %}.
