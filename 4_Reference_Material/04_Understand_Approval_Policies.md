In _Time Off_{:.breadcrumbs}, approval policies define how Peopleware handles time-off requests. Approval policies use [checks](#what-are-checks) and configurable thresholds to enforce company rules around time off.

You can configure specific approval policies for each [time-off type](https://help.peopleware.com/time-off-types-beta). When a person submits a time-off request, Peopleware evaluates it against the active approval policy for the selected type.

An approval policy is a set of rules that determines how the system should handle a time-off request:

- Approve it automatically if all checks pass
- Trigger manual review if a **Review threshold** is exceeded
- Prevent that a time-off request is created if a **Prevent threshold** is exceeded

An approval policy may include one or more checks.

> If no approval policy is configured for a time-off type, the request is not processed automatically and must be reviewed manually.

## Approval policy checks<a name="what-are-checks"></a>

A check evaluates a specific aspect of the time-off request, such as:

- How much entitlement the person has left
- How far in advance the request was submitted
- How many days the person wants to take off

Each check can define a **Review threshold**, a **Prevent threshold**, or both.

Example:

A lead days check might be configured to automatically approve requests submitted more than 14 days in advance without review.

### How checks are evaluated<a name="how-checks-are-evaluated"></a>

When a time-off request is submitted, each check runs independently. The values in the time-off request are compared against the thresholds for each check.

| Condition                               | Outcome                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| All checks passed                       | Automatically approved             |
| Any check exceeds **Review threshold**  | Requires manual review             |
| Any check exceeds **Prevent threshold** | Time-off request cannot be created |

### Types of checks<a name="types-of-checks"></a>

Time Off supports the following types of checks:

- **Consecutive days**: Restricts how many consecutive days off a person can request.
- **Projected balance**: Ensures the requested time off does not exceed the person’s remaining entitlement.
- **Lead time in days**: Requires requests to be submitted a certain number of days in advance.
- **Quota**: Prevents or controls approval of requests that would exceed the projected remaining quota for a planning unit on a given day.
  The projected remaining quota is calculated as `Current remaining quota – Quota consumption for time off`.

Each check uses a specific comparison operator (e.g. `<`, `>`) based on its purpose.

### How checks work<a name="how-checks-work"></a>

Each check analyzes the time-off request to determine if it meets the conditions defined in the time-off approval policy. For example, the **Projected balance** check simulates the person’s entitlement after the request would be booked. The **Lead time in days** check calculates how far in advance the request was made.

For example:

- **Projected balance**: If the projected entitlement is below the Prevent threshold (e.g. < 0), the request cannot be created.
- **Quota**: If this value is below the configured threshold, the system applies the corresponding action.

Checks always account for existing bookings when evaluating new requests.

## Approval policy priority<a name="approval-policy-priority"></a>

Within the same time-off type, approval policies with defined validity periods take precedence over those without. Approval policies with validity periods cannot have overlapping date ranges. Policies without a validity period are considered valid indefinitely.
