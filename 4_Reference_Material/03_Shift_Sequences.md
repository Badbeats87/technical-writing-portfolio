A shift sequence is a series of repeating patterns of day models or activities.

Insert shift sequences into your schedule and have Peopleware optimize the rest of the schedule.

Each shift sequence can include a number of patterns of day models or activities. Such patterns are defined as rows.
Day models and activities are assigned to rows.
Rows are assigned to people.<br>
Shift sequences are inserted into the schedule.
